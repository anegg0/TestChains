# TestChains

Blockchain developing often requires to run a local Blockchain client (AKA: TestChain). This is to make sure your work remains private and that any sent transaction gets a fast response.

In order to speed up the process, this repo contains all you need to spin up a local TestChain in a few minutes. Each of these chains uses PoA (Proof of Authority) as a consensus model for faster response. They all launch using provided scripts, automatically provided with accounts and passwords. 

The preconfigured account is ```0x12890d2cce102216644c59daE5baed380d84830c``` with private key ```0xb5b1870957d373ef0eeffecc6e4812c0fd08f554b37b233526acc331bf1544f7```.

The account key store file password is : ```password```
